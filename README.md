-----Reeling Reaction-----

--How-To-Play-
1. Press 'Ready Up' button, then 'Start!' button to begin
2. After a couple of seconds, a button that states 'Fish!!!' will appear. You have only a small amount of time to press it to get points.
3. There are 3 fish buttons that can appear, and the bigger the fish the bigger the button and less time you have to reel it in.
4. After 10 fish appear the game will end, and the header will change based on the goal you reached.
5. Press 'Fish Another Day?' or 'Reset' buttons when they appear to start over and try again.

My inspiration is that I've seen DnD games that have players put the entire story on hold to fish for a session.

-will have small, medium, and large fish, each giving 8lb., 13lb., and 20lb. respectivly.(math.random will determine which fish bites the line)

-each fish will have a window of time(two setTimeouts) for you to press a button, and for when the fish gets away. The smaller the fish, the more time to press the button.

-to win, you need to get atleast 70lb. before the sun goes down.

--didn't get to making the super rare fish, and coulda probably done something else as time passed than changing the background-color. Also if the window is small enough part of the top or bottom is off the screen.
