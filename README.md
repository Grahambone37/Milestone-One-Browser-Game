-----FISHING GAME-----  
(get an actual title)

My inspiration is that I've seen DnD games that have players put the entire story on hold to fish for a session.

-will have small, medium, and large fish, each giving $5, $10, and $20 respectivly.(math.random will determine which fish bites the line)

-each fish will have a window of time(two setTimeouts) for you to press a button(could be a random keyboard button if i get that far), and for when the fish gets away. The smaller the fish, the more time to press the button.

-to win, you need to make $75 before the sun goes down.(or get secret condition)

-secret condition(if I get the basic fish finsished): reel in BIG FISH(will have like a 0.25% chance) This fish gives $500 and instantly opens up the win screen.
